This is largely unmodified from the default, excepting three **very important changes.**

1. The DNS servers have been set to be 10.60.2.33 and 10.60.2.34. If this isn't here, the processes inside Docker *will not* be able to resolve `patty.reed.edu`.
2. The TLS cert used by Coder is installed.
3. We run `sudo update-ca-certificates` before the init.

# Remote Development on Docker Containers

Provision Docker containers as [Coder workspaces](https://coder.com/docs/workspaces) with this example template.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->

## Prerequisites

### Infrastructure

The VM you run Coder on must have a running Docker socket and the `coder` user must be added to the Docker group:

```sh
# Add coder user to Docker group
sudo adduser coder docker

# Restart Coder server
sudo systemctl restart coder

# Test Docker
sudo -u coder docker ps
```

## Architecture

This template provisions the following resources:

- Docker image (built by Docker socket and kept locally)
- Docker container pod (ephemeral)
- Docker volume (persistent on `/home/coder`)

This means, when the workspace restarts, any tools or files outside of the home directory are not persisted. To pre-bake tools into the workspace (e.g. `python3`), modify the container image. Alternatively, individual developers can [personalize](https://coder.com/docs/dotfiles) their workspaces with dotfiles.

> **Note**
> This template is designed to be a starting point! Edit the Terraform to extend the template to support your use case.

### Editing the image

Edit the `Dockerfile` and run `coder templates push` to update workspaces.
